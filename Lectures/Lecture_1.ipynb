    "Welcome! This is the first of five lectures in this short informal module. For introductory information outlining the class, please see the readme.md file in the [Github repository](https://github.com/crahal/Python_for_DataScience). Please note: this set of five lectures will revolve around Python 3.x, and while you can follow the examples and homeworks in a text-editor ane execute the scripts via the command line, [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are ***strongly*** advised! All important Python concepts are in boldface where possible.\n",

    "#### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this very introductory lecture we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introduce Python and Git\n",
    "* Cover primative data types (characters and numbers)\n",
    "* Introduce various types of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without getting ahead of ourselves, we can note at this early stage that in Python, everything is an object (except control flows), and that it is an object-oriented language (although not a 'pure' one).\n"

    "### Section 1.1: The Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the command line for data science offers powerful capabilities for managing, processing, and analyzing data efficiently. It provides direct access to tools like Python, R, and specialized libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy) for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key tasks include navigating file systems to access datasets, performing complex data transformations using command-line tools (e.g., sed, awk), and automating repetitive tasks with shell scripting. The command line allows for seamless integration of data processing pipelines, enhancing reproducibility and scalability in projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, version control with Git is seamlessly integrated into command-line workflows, enabling tracking of changes in code, data, and analysis scripts. This ensures collaboration and facilitates the documentation of project evolution over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, your use of the command line will vary depending on not just what you are doing, but also on which operating system you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Shell:* Uses Command Prompt (cmd.exe) with its own set of commands.\n",
    "* *File Paths:* Uses backslashes () in file paths (e.g., C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents).\n",
    "* *Capabilities:* Limited compared to Unix-like systems in built-in commands and utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**macOS and Linux:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Shell:* Typically uses Bash or Zsh.\n",
    "* *File Paths:* Uses forward slashes (/) in file paths (e.g., /Users/Username/Documents).\n",
    "* *Capabilities:* Rich set of built-in commands and utilities, extensive support for scripting and automation.\n"

    "### Section 1.2: Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git for Data Science manages version control for data-related projects. It tracks changes in datasets, code, and configuration files, facilitating collaboration and reproducibility. By using Git, data scientists can maintain a history of changes, revert to previous versions, and manage branches for different analysis paths or experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits include transparency in project evolution, enabling teams to understand who made what changes and when. It ensures data integrity by documenting modifications and providing a structured workflow for data manipulation and analysis. Git also supports integration with platforms like GitHub or GitLab for remote collaboration and backup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some useful Git commands for us to think about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **git clone**: Creates a local copy of a remote repository onto your machine. It downloads all files, branches, and commit history from the remote repository to your local environment, allowing you to work on the project locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **git pull**: Updates your local repository with changes from the remote repository. It fetches the latest changes (commits, files) from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch. Useful to synchronize your local repository with the latest changes made by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **git push**: Sends your committed changes from your local repository to the remote repository. After making changes locally and committing them, git push uploads these changes to the corresponding branch on the remote repository, making them accessible to others working on the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **git commit**: Records changes made to the files in your local repository. It captures a snapshot of the current state of files you have staged (added) and stores it as a commit object in the local Git repository. Each commit is accompanied by a commit message that describes the changes made.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is really important that you try to install and familiarise yourself with Git; it's one of the main parts of a data scientist's toolbox. In particular, you should try cloning, or forking the repository which this teaching material is held in, and then try editing and running the scripts (if this is not possible for any reason, simply download the repository)."

    "### Section 1.3: Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language characterized by its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dynamic Typing:** Python uses dynamic typing, meaning variables are not explicitly declared with types. Instead, types are inferred at runtime based on the assigned value. This flexibility allows for easier and more concise code but can lead to runtime errors if types are mismatched.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Procedural Programming:** Python supports procedural programming where tasks are structured into procedures or functions that perform operations on data. It emphasizes step-by-step instructions for solving problems, making it straightforward for beginners and useful for organizing code into reusable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Python is also an object-oriented language, where data and functionality are encapsulated into objects. Objects can interact with each other through methods (functions belonging to classes) and inheritance (deriving new classes from existing ones), promoting modularity and code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Functional Programming:** Python incorporates functional programming concepts such as first-class functions (functions treated as first-class citizens) and lambda expressions (anonymous functions). Functional programming emphasizes functions as the primary building blocks, promoting immutability and pure functions for predictable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automatic Memory Management:** Python features automatic memory management through garbage collection. It automatically allocates memory for new objects and reclaims memory occupied by objects no longer in use, relieving developers from manual memory management tasks present in lower-level languages like C or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's strengths lie in its extensive standard library and third-party packages, facilitating diverse applications in web development, scientific computing, and data analysis. Its interpreted nature allows for rapid development and debugging, while its ecosystem supports frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask), libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas), and tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks) essential for modern software development and data science workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Section 1.3.1: Python 2.* vs Python 3.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2 and Python 3 represent two major versions of the Python programming language, each with distinct differences. Python 2, released in 2000, was widely used but reached its end of life in 2020, ceasing official support and updates. Python 3, introduced in 2008, aimed to fix design flaws, improve consistency, and enhance performance. Key disparities include print syntax (parentheses in Python 3), integer division behavior (Python 3 returns float by default), and Unicode support (Python 3 handles strings as Unicode by default). Python 3 offers significant improvements, yet migration challenges exist due to codebase compatibility issues, impacting adoption rates.\n",

A collection is a means for referring to one or more things at the same time, and Python has many collection types (note: a string can be thought of as a joined up list of characters). In general, collections are **iterable**, which means that you can ask for each item in the collection one-by-one. But beyond that they vary quite dramatically. Here are the major collection *types* that you will come across in Python:"

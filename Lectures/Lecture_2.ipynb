The ordering is actually related to how they are stored in memory and so it could change at any point. The main way to iterate through a collection is to use the infamous *for loop*. This will iteratively 'loop' through all elements of our collection, operating on them one at a time. where 'i' is the conventional iterator, try something like the following:"

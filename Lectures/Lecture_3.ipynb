    "\n",
    "Pseudocode is a common method which enables the programmer to plan without worrying about syntax and tracebacks, with a focus on the operations and methods. We can write down every step, including if conditions and loops, and fill it in a rough and ready fashion, using shortcuts where  we think appropriate. This allows us to ascertain what we do know how to do easily (which we can use shortcuts or shorthand for in the psuedocode), and what we still need to figure out. This skill of abstraction is essential to solving problems as a programmer! Note that psuedocode isnt meant to be ran. The more and more comfortable you become with programming in Python, the less you will need to write or use pseudocode.\n",

    "Perhaps the most important concept that we will cover in this course is the notion of abstraction. To make something more abstract is to articulate or encode some phenomenon in a form that is less contingent or specific. If we can discern the commonalities between different cases, we can apply the same logic in a number of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functional purpose of programming is typically to transform particular cases into more general ones. Instead of renaming every photo in a set of cat photos, we can append \"Cat_\" to all of them. In a broader sense, we are trying to automate or abstract tasks with computers in order to play to their strengths for speed and accuracy.\n",

    "* easier to re-use\n",
    "* more robust\n",
    "* more efficient for the coder.\n",
    "\n",

    "We've spent the majority of the first three lessons talking about the 'standard library'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The standard library:** Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the majority of tools which we need for practical data science come from libraries _outside_ of the standard library. We're now going to talk about the four main, very important ones, although note that we could have made alternative choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose language and as such it can and it is widely used by system administrators for operating system administration, by web developpers as a tool to create dynamic websites and by linguists for natural language processing tasks. Being a truely general-purpose language, Python can of course - without using any special numerical modules - be used to solve numerical problems as well. So far so good, but the crux of the matter is the execution speed. Pure Python without any numerical modules couldn't be used for numerical tasks Matlab, R and other languages are designed for. If it comes to computational problem solving, it is of greatest importance to consider the performance of algorithms, both concerning speed and data usage. If we use Python in combination with its modules NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas and more, it belongs to the top numerical programming languages. It is as efficient - if not even more efficient - than Matlab or R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, also, that you don't need to install any of these tools if you have installed the Anaconda distribution of Python: one of the main benefits of our installation of that is that it takes care of all the bundles of tools that we need as data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a module for Python. The name is an acronym for \"Numeric Python\" or \"Numerical Python\". It is pronounced /ˈnʌmpaɪ/ (NUM-py). It is an extension module for Python, mostly written in C. This makes sure that the precompiled mathematical and numerical functions and functionalities of Numpy guarantee great execution speed. Furthermore, NumPy enriches the programming language Python with powerful data structures, implementing multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. These data structures guarantee efficient calculations with matrices and arrays. The implementation is even aiming at huge matrices and arrays, better know under the heading of \"big data\". Besides that the module supplies a large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these matrices and arrays.\n",

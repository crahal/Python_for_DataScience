    "\n",
    "Pseudocode is a common method which enables the programmer to plan without worrying about syntax and tracebacks, with a focus on the operations and methods. We can write down every step, including if conditions and loops, and fill it in a rough and ready fashion, using shortcuts where  we think appropriate. This allows us to ascertain what we do know how to do easily (which we can use shortcuts or shorthand for in the psuedocode), and what we still need to figure out. This skill of abstraction is essential to solving problems as a programmer! Note that psuedocode isnt meant to be ran. The more and more comfortable you become with programming in Python, the less you will need to write or use pseudocode.\n",

To make something more abstract is to articulate or encode some phenomenon in a form that is less contingent or specific. If we can discern the commonalities between different cases, we can apply the same logic in a number of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functional purpose of programming is typically to transform particular cases into more general ones.

In a broader sense, we are trying to automate or abstract tasks with computers in order to play to their strengths for speed and accuracy.\n",

So far so good, but the crux of the matter is the execution speed. Pure Python without any numerical modules couldn't be used for numerical tasks Matlab, R and other languages are designed for. If it comes to computational problem solving, it is of greatest importance to consider the performance of algorithms, both concerning speed and data usage.

Furthermore, NumPy enriches the programming language Python with powerful data structures, implementing multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. These data structures guarantee efficient calculations with matrices and arrays. The implementation is even aiming at huge matrices and arrays, better know under the heading of \"big data\".
